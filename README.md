**What is Flexafen?** 
======================

Joint pain is one of the most common reasons that consumers experience discomfort, especially as they get older. Consumers everywhere seem to blame the lack of support in their joints on their age, believing that their diminished collagen levels and increased inflammation are just normal reactions to their body’s changes. Instead, the actual problem comes down to the need for the right nutrients, balancing a condition that causes all of this inflammation. 

To rectify this imbalance, consumers might want to consider the use of a new remedy called Flexafen. By spending just a few seconds a day to take the capsule, consumers can start to feel the relief that they need from the stiffness and pain in their joints. They revive mobility for any user, making it easier for them to get the support they had during younger years. 

When consumers have to constantly deal with the discomfort and inflammation of chronic pain, they’ll try nearly any solution to overcome it. Unfortunately, all of these methods aren’t safe or even effective, depending on how dedicated the user is to their regimen. Surgery is only an option for some conditions, and going through physical therapy can put the muscles through exhaustion. While it may help with mobility, the pain might still remain. Creating a healthy environment in the body to be free of the pain is the smartest way to ensure healing and relief.

**Why Does Flexafen Work?** 
============================

The whole point of this regimen is to finally stop the dangerous attack that is happening on the joints. As the body goes through physical exertion and natural aging, the collagen that provides the cushion between joints starts to diminish. While this concern isn’t as big of a problem in younger years, continued physical activity and exposure to any environment can take a toll. 

Consumers who use this formula will find that it is fairly close to the natural collagen that the body contains. The formula gradually helps consumers to rebuild the collagen that they lost, which means that they are able to feel the support that makes them mobile in the first place.

**What Ingredients Are Found in Flexafen?**
===========================================

The whole Flexafen formula is rather simple and straightforward, only combining a few ingredients to make a difference in the user’s pain. Those ingredients include:  

*   MSM 

*   ApresFlex 

*   White willow bark extract 

*   Collavent n2 

*   Sodium hyaluronate 

*   Boron  
    

Read on below to learn about the way that each of these ingredients affect consumers: 

**MSM** 

The first and most potent ingredient that consumers will get from the Flexafen formula is MSM, or Methylsulfonylmethane. MSM is used for a multitude of concerns, but it is especially helpful for anyone with arthritis, joint pain, or post-exercise muscle soreness. The main reason that it has such a positive effect is because of the organic sulfur that it uses. This ingredient is crucial for the building of healthy bones and joints, and it even supports the immune system with its increased production of immunoglobulins. These effects can lead to relief from allergies for some consumers. 

MSM is known for having an antioxidant effect on the body, and it is necessary to help the body to produce collagen and glucosamine, which is necessary to keep bones and joints supported. While it is not typically associated with any side effects, some people find that they experience some acne, dizziness, diarrhea, and pimples. 

**ApresFlex** 

ApresFlex is a patented ingredient that is specifically made to be effective for health joints and connective tissues. Unlike other ingredients on this list that are backed up by general scientific evidence, this specific formula has been clinically studied to ensure the effect on the body. It is formulated to be more bioavailable than the main ingredient – Boswellia serrata – to allow consumers to get a more intense effect. 

According to these clinical studies, consumers generally start to feel the healing in their joints in a matter of 5 days. However, when combined with the other ingredients in this formula, consumers might take up to a month to have the full effect on their chronic pain. Boswellia serrata, which is also known as Indian frankincense, has been used for centuries to alleviate inflammation already, but this formulation makes it more potent. 

**White Willow** 

The white willow is a type of European willow that is also found in many parts of Asia. The name comes from the underside of the leaves, which are a stark white contrast to the vibrant green topside. In Flexafen, consumers get the support of an extract that is sourced from the bark, which contains salicin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Collavant n2** 

Collavant n2, which was previously called b-2Cool, is a type 2 collagen that is sourced from chicken sternum. It is undenatured, which means that it is a protein that hasn’t gone through structural deformation. It comes from the cartilage of the chicken, and it hasn’t been overly processed. However, it helps consumers to strengthen their own cartilage, which offers support and flexibility in the joints. Since collagen and cartilage both diminish with constant movement and exposure to toxins, restoring it is an important step to improving pain. 

**Sodium Hyaluronate** 

Sodium Hyaluronate is one of the most common ingredients to find in anti-aging remedies because of the profound moisture support that it provides. When the body loses its ability to effectively maintain collagen in the joints, it is almost certain that it is also seen in the skin at the same time. Collagen makes it possible for the skin to hold onto moisture as well, so introducing an ingredient that can restore what it has lost instantly improves the youthful appearance of users. 

**Boron** 

Boron is the last ingredient of this compilation, but it is quite important to healing the joints. This chemical is only needed in small amounts, helping users to reduce their risk of joint pain and bone injuries. However, when the body doesn’t get enough of it, the growth and regeneration of bone tissue can be detrimentally impacted.
